The Hashtag Generator

The marketing team is spending way too much time typing in hashtags.
Let's help them with our own Hashtag Generator!

Here's the deal:

It must start with a hashtag (#).
All words must have their first letter capitalized.
If the final result is longer than 140 chars it must return false.
If the input or the result is an empty string it must return false.

Good vs Evil

The function will be given two parameters. Each parameter will be a string of multiple integers separated by a single space. Each string will contain the count of each race on the side of good and evil.

Directions Reduction

Once upon a time, on a way through the old wild mountainous west,…
… a man was given directions to go from one point to another. The directions were "NORTH", "SOUTH", "WEST", "EAST". Clearly "NORTH" and "SOUTH" are opposite, "WEST" and "EAST" too.

Going to one direction and coming back the opposite direction right away is a needless effort. Since this is the wild west, with dreadful weather and not much water, it's important to save yourself some energy, otherwise you might die of thirst!

Roman Numerals Helper

Create a RomanNumerals class that can convert a roman numeral to and from an integer value. It should follow the API demonstrated in the examples below. Multiple roman numeral values will be tested for each helper method.

Modern Roman numerals are written by expressing each digit separately starting with the left most digit and skipping any digit with a value of zero. In Roman numerals 1990 is rendered: 1000=M, 900=CM, 90=XC; resulting in MCMXC. 2008 is written as 2000=MM, 8=VIII; or MMVIII. 1666 uses each Roman symbol in descending order: MDCLXVI.

Sum Strings as Numbers

Given the string representations of two integers, return the string representation of the sum of those integers.

For example:

sumStrings('1','2') // => '3'

Range Extraction


A format for expressing an ordered list of integers is to use a comma separated list of either

individual integers
or a range of integers denoted by the starting integer separated from the end integer in the range by a dash, '-'. The range includes all integers in the interval including both endpoints. It is not considered a range unless it spans at least 3 numbers. For example "12,13,15-17"
Complete the solution so that it takes a list of integers in increasing order and returns a correctly formatted string in the range format.

Example:

solution([-10, -9, -8, -6, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20]);
// returns "-10--8,-6,-3-1,3-5,7-11,14,15,17-20"

Human Readable Time
Write a function, which takes a non-negative integer (seconds) as input and returns the time in a human-readable format (HH:MM:SS)

HH = hours, padded to 2 digits, range: 00 - 99
MM = minutes, padded to 2 digits, range: 00 - 59
SS = seconds, padded to 2 digits, range: 00 - 59
The maximum time never exceeds 359999 (99:59:59)

You can find some examples in the test fixtures.

Next bigger number with the same digits
Create a function that takes a positive integer and returns the next bigger number that can be formed by rearranging its digits. For example:

12 ==> 21
513 ==> 531
2017 ==> 2071

Playing with digits

89 --> 8¹ + 9² = 89 * 1

695 --> 6² + 9³ + 5⁴= 1390 = 695 * 2

46288 --> 4³ + 6⁴+ 2⁵ + 8⁶ + 8⁷ = 2360688 = 46288 * 51

Are they the "same"?


Given two arrays a and b write a function comp(a, b) (orcompSame(a, b)) that checks whether the two arrays have the "same" elements, with the same multiplicities (the multiplicity of a member is the number of times it appears). "Same" means, here, that the elements in b are the elements in a squared, regardless of the order.

Examples
Valid arrays
a = [121, 144, 19, 161, 19, 144, 19, 11]  
b = [121, 14641, 20736, 361, 25921, 361, 20736, 361]

Valid Parentheses
Write a function that takes a string of parentheses, and determines if the order of the parentheses is valid. The function should return true if the string is valid, and false if it's invalid.

Duplicate Encoder
The goal of this exercise is to convert a string to a new string where each character in the new string is "(" if that character appears only once in the original string, or ")" if that character appears more than once in the original string. Ignore capitalization when determining if a character is a duplicate.

Counting Duplicates

Count the number of Duplicates
Write a function that will return the count of distinct case-insensitive 
alphabetic characters and numeric digits that occur more than once in 
the input string. The input string can be assumed to contain 
only alphabets (both uppercase and lowercase) and numeric digits.

Unique In Order
Implement the function unique_in_order which takes as argument a sequence and returns a list of items without any elements with the same value next to each other and preserving the original order of elements.

For example:

uniqueInOrder('AAAABBBCCDAABBB') == ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'A', 'B']
uniqueInOrder('ABBCcAD')         == ['A', 'B', 'C', 'c', 'A', 'D']
uniqueInOrder([1,2,2,3,3])       == [1,2,3]

Find the unique number
There is an array with some numbers. All numbers are equal except for one. Try to find it!

findUniq([ 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1 ]) === 2
findUniq([ 0, 0, 0.55, 0, 0 ]) === 0.55
It’s guaranteed that array contains at least 3 numbers.

The tests contain some very huge arrays, so think about performance.
